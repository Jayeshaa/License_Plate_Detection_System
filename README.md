# License_Plate_Detection_System

The License Plate Detection System is a comprehensive application designed to detect vehicles, track their movements, and read their license plates from images or video frames. This system utilizes advanced technologies for accurate vehicle detection and license plate recognition, and it incorporates a custom sorting algorithm from a GitHub repository for vehicle tracking.


# Key Features

Vehicle Detection

YOLOv8 Model for vehicle detection: An advanced object detection model that accurately detects vehicles. The model is saved as a .pt file.

Vehicle Tracking

Sorting Algorithm: Implements a custom sorting algorithm sourced from a GitHub repository to track vehicles across frames. This algorithm maintains vehicle identities and tracks their movement effectively.

License Plate Recognition

EasyOCR: An optical character recognition library that reads and extracts text from license plates with high accuracy.

Detection Outputs
Bounding Box Coordinates: Provides coordinates for bounding boxes around detected vehicles (x1, y1, x2, y2).

Detection Score: Outputs confidence scores for each detection.

Class ID: Identifies the class of the detected object (e.g., vehicle type).

# Applications
The License Plate Detection System is ideal for various applications including:

Traffic Management: Monitoring and managing vehicle flow in urban areas.

Security and Surveillance: Enhancing security by recognizing and tracking vehicles in restricted areas.

Parking Management: Automating parking lot management and monitoring.

Law Enforcement: Assisting in vehicle tracking and identification for enforcement purposes.

# Conclusion

The License Plate Detection System integrates advanced vehicle detection, tracking, and license plate recognition technologies to deliver a powerful solution for vehicle identification and monitoring. Its use of YOLOv8 for detection, tracking algorithms, and EasyOCR for license plate reading ensures high accuracy and efficiency in a variety of practical scenarios.
